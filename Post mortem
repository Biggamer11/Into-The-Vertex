1.Did you fail to implement any features you planned in your design document? Why?
I did not fail to implement any features. Although there were things that i did think of that i did not get arround to that was not in the documument just simply becouse i ran out of time.

2.Did you make any improvements to the systems of your game over the course of implementation? How did you decide to make these changes?
I was originally planning on making it a serrious implementation but it turned out i think it works better that its a little light hearted. I did this becouse the feeling of the game just did not feel right otherwise.

3. If you were to continue development on this game, do you have any planned improvementsor new features?
I would improve the enemy AI, implement a cover system and if i didn't have any restrictions get rid of the primitives restriction
